    Problem Statement
        1. AUTOMATE: Moving files from one SFTP file server to another based on certain criteria and log it.
        2. Required a connection credentials every time for the sending sftp connection. (if the username/ password changed)
        3. Two files with the same name can occur. [one after moving other]
        

    Database
        Based on Logged-in SFTP server
            Create/ get the database name from the MAIN_SFTP_DB Mapping Database.
            Connect it to the fetched database
            Moved_files: {
                filename,
                host:port,
                username,
                updated_time,
                destination_host:port
            }
